Perform the following steps in order to install the application:

1) Database setup

You'll need two databases: One that contains original Wikipedia revision data (replication database), and one for application data.

Replication database:
- Get a Wikipedia dump file from http://dumps.wikimedia.org/ - you don't need the full history dumps, history metadata stubs are sufficient (something like "xyz-20120101-stub-meta-history.xml").
- Import it into your replication database (see http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Importing_XML_dumps for help)

Application database:
- Create another MySQL database and import install.sql


2) Eigenvalue generator

The 'evgen' tool calculates eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors and is automatically called by the php script. Before you compile it, you must enter your database connection details in "evgen/evgen.cpp". The "dbname" variable refers to the application database.

Compiling for Linux/Solaris: Navigate to the "Debug" folder an run "make all". This should create the binary and save it in "htdocs/evgen".

Make sure that it can be executed by your web server user.


3) Configuration

Open the file "htdocs/config.php" and insert your database connection details. While $dbname refers to the application database, $dbnamelocalwiki refers to the replication database.

Now the application should be operable. Note that you need a WebGL-enabled browser for using it.
