1) Running parse.pl

- Make sure you have the DBI, Time::Local, Text::CSV and XML::Parser::PerlSAX Perl modules installed.

- Create a MySQL database and load the setup from install.sql

- Get a Wikipedia stub file from http://dumps.wikimedia.org/

- Run 'perl parse.pl CONNECTION ARTICLES DTMAX DUMPFILE' with
    CONNECTION : database credentials in the form "dbname,dbhost,dbuser,dbpass"
    ARTICLES : page titles whose history you want to analyse as comma-separated list, e.g. "Alan Smithee, Ang Lee, Aussagenlogik" (use those double quotes!)
    DTMAX : the maximum time difference between edits (as integer)
    DUMPFILE : path to the Wikipedia dump file

2) Eigenvalue generator

The 'evgen' tool calculated eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors and is automatically called by the php script.

- Run 'evgen "Articlename" "SessionID" ' (for a debug html output add a third parameter, e.g. 'evgen Articlename xyz debug')
